Description: Provides methods to compute simultaneous (functional) prediction and confidence bands 
    for (dense) time series data. Supports both independent and hierarchical (clustered) 
    designs using deterministic bootstrap resampling. Includes a simple API ('band()') 
    and an Rcpp backend for performance.
